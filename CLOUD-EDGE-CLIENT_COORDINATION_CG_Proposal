The mission of this group is to explore mechanisms and interfaces between Central Cloud, Edge-Cloud, and Client for computing workload offloading and orchestration. 
The typical use cases include AI acceleration, cloud gaming, and streaming acceleration. The goal is to explore the feasibility of defining a set of new APIs and mechanisms 
that enable computing workload offloading and orchestration between Central Cloud, Edge Cloud and Client. It should leverage existing mechanisms as much as possible 
and should coordinate with related W3C working groups and other SDOs and open-source communities if necessary.
